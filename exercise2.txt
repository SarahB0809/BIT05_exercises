# Exercise 2: Normalisation of data
# UNF
	DB(staffNo, denistsName, patientNo, patientName, appointment, surgeryNo)
# 1NF
	DB(*staffNo*, dentistName, patientNo, patientName, *appointment_date*, appointment_time, surgeryNo)
	primary key: staffNo and appointmentdate
	We don't have duplicate groups so we don't have to eliminate them --> 1NF is done

# 2NF: no partial dependencies --> the whole column needs to be dependend on the primary key
	#names of the dentist and patients are not dependend on the primary key --> dependend on staffNo and
	Dentist(*staffNo*, dentistsName)
	DB(*staffNo*, patientNo, patientName, *appdate*, *appTime*, surgeryNo)

# 3NF: no transitive dependencies --> columns shouldn't been dependend on a non primary key column
	Dentist(*staffNo*, dentistsName)
	Patient(*patientNo*, patientName)
	DB(*staffNo*, *patientNo*, *appdate*, *appTime*, surgeryNo)

# BCNF: 
	The BCNF = 3NF --> no changes are needed
