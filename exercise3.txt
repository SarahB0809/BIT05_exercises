# Exercise 3 solution

	UNF: paNo, paName, waNo, bedNo,	[drugNo, drugName, description,	dosage,	MOA, Un/d, start, finished] 

	1NF: paNo, paName, waNo, bedNo, [drugNo, drugName, description, dosage, MOA, Un/d, start, finished]
	Changes that need to be made:
		* No repeating group
	groups to make:
		* PatientNo --> full name
		* Ward no --> 
	DB: *paNo*, paName, waNo, bedNo, *drugNo*, drugName, description, dosage, MOA, Un/d *start*, finished

	2NF: no partial dependencies --> every column should be dependent on the primary key
	two new tables:
		1) Patient: *paNo*, paName, waNo, bedNo, waName
		2) Drug: *drugNo*, drugName, description, dosage, MOA
		3) DB: *paNo*, *drugNo*, Un/d, *start*, finished 

	3NF: no transetive dependencies
	Wardname is entirely dependend on ward number--> but it is not dependend on anything else
	1 new table:
		1) Patient: *paNo*, paName, waNo, bedNo
                2) Drug: *drugNo*, drugName, description, dosage, MOA
                3) DB: *paNo*, *drugNo*, Un/d, *start*,	finished 
		4) Ward: *waNo*, waName

	BCNF: any determinant is a candidate key -> are there any other possible keys?
	check if the primary key can be changed by another column of their table
	there are no determinantss in this key --> the 3NF = BCNF
